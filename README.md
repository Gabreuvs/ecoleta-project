## Description about Project

Repository dedicated to Rocketseat's Next Level Week activities

Next Level Week was a week of classes taught by Rocketseat, in which the students were able to learn a lot and start their journey in web development.

We had five days of intense coding with the aim of build an application that simulates a marketplace for waste collection. For this purpose, we learned about html, css and javascript for do the frontend, besides node.js and sql to construct the backend.

It was a great experience, mainly for who are starting at web development.
